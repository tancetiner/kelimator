### Introduction
A simple Turkish word-game built with python with the help of the "Pygame" module.
The game is round-based. In each round, player is given eight letters (3 vowels and 5 surds) to form many words as he/she can in 60 seconds. Player gets points as he/she forms words (see "Score Calculation section for further details) and can see the words he/she unable to form at the end of each round.
