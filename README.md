# Kelimator

### Introduction
A simple Turkish word-game built with python with the help of the "Pygame" module.
The game is round-based. In each round, player is given eight letters (3 vowels and 5 surds) to form many words as he/she can in 60 seconds. Player gets points as he/she forms words (see "Score Calculation section for further details) and can see the words he/she unable to form at the end of each round. A screen is displayed which asks if player wants to play for another round or quit.

### Motivation (Story Time!)
During my middle-school years one of the best activities I had with my mother was playing a web-based game "Kelimat√∂r". Both my mom and I were passionate about word-games and it was a great way to spend time together. So, after years passed, one day I remembered that game and immediately googled it but it was not there.

I found out that there were many people wants to play the game like me. They were commenting to the facebook page of the game. Obviously the page was not active but it does not stop passionate word-game communities, does it?

So, I was already in a mood to do something in my area - in a summer without a internship :/ - and I had some experience with the Pygame module before (see "fizikciler") so I said: "Why not create the game by myself?". Obviously, it was going to be much simpler than the original one but I needed to start from somewhere. Then I started and built that...
